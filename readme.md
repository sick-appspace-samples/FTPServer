## FTPServer

Creating and using FTP Server

### Description

Script sets up a FTP server that listens on (default) port 21 and serves the
content of the project's resources folder.

### How to Run

To demo this sample any FTP client can be used to connect to the server (127.0.0.1:21)
using anonymous login and to browse the contents.

### Implementation

The file "test.txt" can be downloaded. Uploading files is not possible as the
user's home directory is set to 'resources'. If uploading should be tested as
well, it must be changed to 'private'.
